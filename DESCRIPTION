Description: Using 2021 Census data for England and Wales, this Shiny app allows the user to
             explore geographical trends in health and socio-demographic factors. Using Merseyside
             as a case study, users can look at associations between health and socio-demographic
             data at the small area-level, and use linear models to assess the strength of these
             associations.
